Please note, that firms/consultants who have not indicated in an e-mail to Michael  Ridley by April 11th that they will be submitting a proposal will not receive any further  information or question responses.  Background  First, some background on the ODL. For the last two years the Ontario Library Association  has acted as a catalyst, bringing together the stakeholders needed to create the Ontario  Digital Library (ODL). These stakeholders include Ontario’s 5000+ public libraries, university,  college, and school libraries, as well as Ontario government ministries.  Libraries that serve very different clientele recognize that by working together they can create  seamless access to quality electronic library services. Through the ODL, students will be  able to explore a topic at school, use the same child-safe resources after school (either at  home or at a public library), enter college or university with a knowledge of how to use  electronic resources that are still available and then, after graduation, continue to use these  skills and resources at work or at home.  We are moving into a period of convergence. With convergence we no longer have to license  commercial products as individual libraries or institutions. We can work together to spend our  money wisely. The provincial government has made this possible by working hard to provide  all Ontarians with a stable, high-speed communications infrastructure. While there is still a  great deal of work needed to improve this infrastructure, libraries are beginning to plan how  best to exploit communications technology. We can reduce barriers to access and create the  content infrastructure needed to support a knowledge society.  The concept of an ODL is a key element in The Roadmap to Prosperity, a strategic plan to  envision and attain Ontario’s economic goal prepared by the Ontario Jobs and Investment  Board. The OJIB strategic plan recommends an electronic library to “connect students to new  workplaces, new sources of information and applied learning opportunities”. The ODL will do  that and much more. The ODL will connect students to electronic information, and will also  leverage this investment to help connect all citizens to the electronic information they need as  they make decisions, solve problems and enhance their quality of life.  Libraries have long been a key delivery point for public services. The ODL will allow that  delivery point to move closer to citizens, into the smallest of libraries and even into living  rooms.  Libraries have a long tradition of using a practical, consultative approach to solving problems,  and of learning from others. The ODL is a very practical solution to various problems.  Jurisdiction-wide digital libraries are very practical and very real. The ODL we propose is  leading edge for Ontario but several jurisdictions have forged the path with collaborative  digital libraries. We can learn from their experiences.

      "refined_text": "capabilities. The challenge is to secure resources sufficient to both sustain the original investments and  to enhance the ODL.  The ongoing funding of the ODL will be based on a partnership model involving all the key participants  (i.e. government, libraries, donors, public and private sectors). All participants (i.e. beneficiaries) are  expected to make financial contributions to the ODL. It is important in achieving the full impact of the  ODL on Ontario’s economy, society and learning support that all library sectors are participants  (university, colleges, public libraries and schools).  The proposed funding model requires a continuing government investment, but also recognizes that as  the ODL matures a growing share of ODL funding will come from libraries and non-governmental  sources. During the 3-year implementation phase (2004 – 2006) libraries will realign their budgets to  enable ongoing funding contributions to ODL. During the same period ODL must build the proposed  endowment and secure public and private sector gifts and/or in-kind contributions. The following chart  outlines the model. This model is based on these assumptions:  1. that ODL expenditures will increase by 50% over a 10 year period  2. that government funding will decrease from 70% to 45% during that 10 year period  3. that library contributions, endowment and gifts/in-kind funding will increase from 30% to 55%  during the same period  OVERVIEW OF ODL FUNDING MODEL  Funding Source  2007  2017  Government  $35M (70%)  $33.75M (45%)  Libraries  $10M (20%)  $22.5M (30%)  Endowment  $4.5M (9%)  $15M (20%)  Gifts/In-Kind  $0.5M (1%)  $3.75M (5%)  TOTAL ANNUAL  $50M $75M While the private sector will be invited to participate in the ODL through the endowment, gifts and in- kind contributions, the ODL will also explore compatible commercial services which leverage the reach  of the ODL and help to offset operating costs.  A $50M budget leverages the consortium buying power of the province’s libraries to secure the best  prices for information resources, the widest accessibility and the most favourable contracts. A budget of  this nature will ensure a core digital collection of sufficient scope and coverage to address a substantial  amount of the wide and diverse information and learning needs of the citizens of Ontario (an overview  of the nature of the ODL digital collection is appended). The proposed ODL expenditures in 2006  represent an investment of $5.00 per citizen.  It is important to recognize that every new dollar per citizen invested in the Ontario Digital Library has a  double benefit: it supports a province-wide library of high quality information resources and it  strengthens every local library in Ontario by allowing them to reinvest existing dollars in new resources  that enhance local services. This multiplier means that for every dollar invested in ODL the return  on investment is worth $2 of value for Ontario.

Introduction to the Foundation Level Extensions  This overview document is intended for anyone with an interest in the ISTQB Foundation Level  Extensions who wants a high-level introduction to the leading principles and an overview of the individual  extension syllabi.  From time to time, ISTQB will update this document to reflect any additional extensions that shall be  introduced for the Foundation Level, or to reflect major changes in existing ones. Publications of the  updated document will be available on the ISTQB website.  The ISTQB Foundation and Advanced Level syllabi have been defined and have been on the market for  some time. New topics emerge due to technology and methodology changes in the market which often  are brought into the ISTQB program as new Expert Level syllabi. However, not all topics are suited for the  Expert Level. For this reason, the extension syllabi are established at the Foundation Level to expand the  ISTQB program to incorporate new or updated knowledge. New extensions shall be discussed and  introduced by the ISTQB periodically. Extensions may be established at the Advanced Level as well, but  that is beyond the scope of this document.  The following Foundation Level Extension syllabus has been released:    Agile Tester  In this document, each Foundation Level Extension syllabus is summarized and the associated Business  Outcomes are stated. The Business Outcomes communicate what can be expected from a person who  achieves a Foundation Level Extension Certification in a particular subject area (e.g., Agile Tester), and  will outline the benefits for companies that are considering the development of specific testing skills at this  level.
